Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int minprice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int profit = 0;
        for(int p : prices){
            minprice = Math.min(minprice, p);
            profit = Math.max(profit, p - minprice);
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
